This program is a javascript simulation for a physical pendulum. The code includes various pendulum functions that can be used
to animate several models of pendulum motion including simple harmonic motion, damped motion, driving force, and 'chaotic' motion.
The program includes a function that simultaneously draws a corresponding waveform with the pendulum.
